# Client side block

Makes the blocker determine if a bullet was blocked or not.

## Description

Normally whether a bullet gets blocked or not is determined by the shooter, which makes blocking mostly useless in online play. This mod changes it so that the shooter first asks the target player if they blocked or not before damage is dealt.

This causes all direct damage to be seemingly dealt with a slight delay (depending on the latency between the shooter and target), but blocking becomes more consistent.
